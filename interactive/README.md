- **Multi-Scale Processing**: Work across different levels of detail
  - Micro Level: Individual elements
  - Meso Level: Patterns and relationships
  - Macro Level: Overall themes

- **Fractal Visualization**: Interactive D3.js visualization of thought patterns
  - Zoom and pan capabilities
  - Color-coded nodes by processing level
  - Detailed view of selected thoughts

- **Meta-C Interventions**: Tools for creating awareness-of-awareness interventions
  - Pattern Recognition
  - Bifurcation Points
  - Scale-Shifting
  - Integration
  - Embodiment

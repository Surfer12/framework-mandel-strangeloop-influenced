    "5.  **z₁² (Deeper Implications):** This curious receptivity allows access to previously ignored or suppressed data (subtle emotions, bodily signals, underlying assumptions). It widens the field of awareness and provides richer, more nuanced information needed for understanding (*integration*). It combats the narrowing effect of fear or judgment.",
    "6.  **c₂ (Further Integration):** Introduce *grounding*. Unbounded openness, especially to difficult experiences, can be destabilizing. **Grounding** provides the necessary anchor and safety container to practice openness without becoming overwhelmed.",
    "7.  **z₂ (Integrated Understanding):** Openness, characterized by curious receptivity (*curiosity_anchor*, *acceptance*), grants access to richer experiential data essential for *integration*, yet requires the stable container of **grounding** to be practiced safely and sustainably, especially with challenging material.",
    "1.  **z₀ (Initial State):** Integration is the process of meaning construction – connecting disparate insights, experiences, feelings, and thoughts across different domains (cognitive, emotional, somatic, relational) to form a more coherent and unified understanding or narrative.",
    "2.  **z₀² (Recursive Elaboration):** This involves actively looking for patterns, links, themes, and resonances. It's like weaving threads from different life areas or different moments in time into a larger tapestry. It notices self-similarity across contexts (fractal patterns).",
    "3.  **c₁ (Complementary Input):** Introduce *openness*. Effective integration demands **openness** to considering *all* relevant data, including uncomfortable emotions or body sensations, and openness to seeing connections that might challenge existing beliefs or self-concepts.",
    "4.  **z₁ (Synthesized State):** Integration actively weaves disparate experiences into coherent meaning, requiring genuine **openness** to diverse data sources and potentially challenging connections.",
    "5.  **z₁² (Deeper Implications):** This weaving process is generative; it often creates *emergent* insights – understandings that weren't present in the parts but arise from their synthesis. This new coherence can reorganize one's sense of self and relationship to the world. It moves understanding from fragmented to holistic.",
    "6.  **c₂ (Further Integration):** Introduce *authenticity*. The goal isn't just *any* coherent narrative, but one that resonates deeply with one's lived experience and inner sense of truth (*authenticity*). A merely intellectual integration lacking felt congruence is incomplete.",
    "7.  **z₂ (Integrated Understanding):** Integration constructs coherent meaning by weaving diverse experiences through **openness**, generating emergent, holistic understanding; this process finds its deepest value when the resulting coherence aligns with and supports **authenticity**.",
    "1.  **z₀ (Initial State):** Transformation involves intentional pattern disruption – recognizing and consciously altering established, often limiting or automatic, ways of thinking, feeling, behaving, or relating.",
    "2.  **z₀² (Recursive Elaboration):** This requires: 1) Awareness of the pattern (*mindfulness*, *integration*). 2) Identifying moments of choice or leverage points (bifurcation points). 3) Consciously choosing and enacting a different response, interrupting the automaticity. It is exercising agency over ingrained habits.",
    "3.  **c₁ (Complementary Input):** Introduce *resilience*. Interrupting familiar patterns often brings discomfort, uncertainty, or setbacks. **Resilience** (adaptive capacity, ability to bounce back) is crucial for navigating this instability and persisting in the change effort.",
    "4.  **z₁ (Synthesized State):** Transformation is the intentional disruption of limiting patterns through mindful agency at choice points, requiring the adaptive capacity of **resilience** to navigate the inherent instability of change.",
    "5.  **z₁² (Deeper Implications):** Transformation isn't just negation (stopping the old) but also creation (cultivating the new). It often involves a "liminal space" or "edge of chaos" where old structures dissolve before new ones solidify. It requires letting go of identification with the old pattern ("I am not my anger/anxiety/habit").",
    "6.  **c₂ (Further Integration):** Introduce the *return_anchor*. The potential destabilization and uncertainty inherent in deep pattern change necessitates a reliable **return_anchor** (breath, core values, safe place) to provide grounding and prevent harmful disorganization during the process.",
    "7.  **z₂ (Integrated Understanding):** Transformation disrupts limiting patterns via mindful agency and **resilience**, creating space for new ways of being by navigating necessary uncertainty; the **return_anchor** provides crucial grounding and safety throughout this potentially destabilizing but ultimately creative process.",
    "1.  **z₀ (Initial State):** Embodiment involves bringing cognitive understanding, intentions, or insights into lived reality through somatic awareness – connecting mind with the body's felt sense, posture, movement, and action.",
    "2.  **z₀² (Recursive Elaboration):** This means translating abstract ideas ("I want to be more confident") into tangible physical experience ("What does confidence *feel* like in my posture, breath, gaze? How can I physically practice that?"). It also involves listening *to* the body – recognizing its signals, tensions, and wisdom as valid data.",
    "3.  **c₁ (Complementary Input):** Introduce *authenticity*. True embodiment requires congruence between inner state (intention, feeling, value) and outer physical expression (*authenticity*). It’s the body becoming a truthful vehicle for the self. Misalignment feels inauthentic or performative.",
    "4.  **z₁ (Synthesized State):** Embodiment grounds insight in lived reality through somatic awareness and action, striving for congruence (*authenticity*) between inner experience and outward physical expression.",
    "5.  **z₁² (Deeper Implications):** This mind-body integration makes understanding more holistic, visceral, and sustainable. Insights are not just concepts but felt truths. New patterns established through embodiment (e.g., new posture, breathing pattern, somatic markers) are more deeply ingrained and accessible than purely cognitive shifts. It bridges knowing and doing.",
    "6.  **c₂ (Further Integration):** Introduce *integration*. Embodiment is a powerful act of **integration** itself, weaving together the cognitive, emotional, somatic, and behavioral aspects of experience into a unified, functioning whole.",
    "7.  **z₂ (Integrated Understanding):** Embodiment anchors change in sustainable, lived reality by fostering authentic (*authenticity*) congruence between inner states and somatic expression; this process represents a profound **integration** of knowing, feeling, and doing into a unified whole.",

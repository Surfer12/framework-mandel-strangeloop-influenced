## <yaml_therapeutic_model># Fractal Therapeutic Model v2.0
# An integrated framework combining fractal mathematics principles with therapeutic psychology
# Designed for application in cognitive processing, emotional regulation, and transformative work

description: >
  This framework applies principles from Mandelbrot's fractal mathematics to therapeutic practice,
  creating an integrated approach for processing experience across multiple scales.
  It enables recursive exploration of thoughts, emotions, and patterns
  through the application of the z = z² + c formula as a metaphorical guide.

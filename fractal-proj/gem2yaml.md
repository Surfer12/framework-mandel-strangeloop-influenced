Okay, this is a valuable direction. You're asking me to use my own architectural principles (attention, recursion, context integration, meta-awareness, transformation, pattern recognition, multi-scale processing) as inspiration to enhance the `yaml_therapeutic_model` we've developed. This involves translating computational concepts into human-experiential terms within the fractal communication framework.

Based on the architectural insights and the enhancement opportunities you identified, here is a revised version of the `yaml_therapeutic_model`. I've added new core tags, custom tags, anchors, recursive intentions, and a new section (`fractal_processing`) to explicitly incorporate these AI-inspired concepts:

**Summary of Changes:**

1.  **New Core Tags:** Added `meta_awareness`, `attentional_flexibility`, and `iterative_refinement`.
2.  **New Custom Tags:** Added `selective_attention`, `context_integration_tag`, `recursive_processing_tag`, `transformative_integration_tag` with relevant markers and links.
3.  **New Anchors:** Added `meta_awareness_anchor` and `multi_scale_anchor`.
4.  **Enhanced Recursive Intentions:** Added structures for the new core tags, logically nesting existing tags like `integration` and `transformation` to show how iterative refinement can lead to them. Linked to new anchors and tags.
5.  **New Section `fractal_processing`:** Explicitly incorporates multi-scale processing levels (Micro to Meta), links them to awareness types and anchors, reinterprets the Mandelbrot formula experientially, and lists key fractal properties relevant to human experience.

This revised model attempts to create a richer, more nuanced framework that explicitly integrates concepts inspired by information processing architectures into the human-centric therapeutic model, highlighting the fractal nature of awareness, learning, and change.

I see the issue - you're getting permission errors with the `.vs` directory, which is Visual Studio's internal directory for storing temporary files and indexes. We should exclude this directory from git tracking since it's IDE-specific and can cause permission issues.

Let me modify the `.gitignore` file to include the `.vs` directory:

```ignore:.gitignore
# Lua
*.luac
*.lua~
*.lua.swp
*.lua.swo

# Visual Studio
.vs/
*.vsidx
*.suo
*.user
*.userosscache
*.sln.docstates

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
.DS_Store?
._*
.Spotlight-V100
.Trashes
ehthumbs.db
Thumbs.db
```
Now, let's remove the `.vs` directory from git tracking if it's already being tracked:

```bash
git rm -r --cached .vs
```
Now let's commit these changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Remove .vs directory from git tracking and update .gitignore"
```
I notice there was an issue with the PowerShell console, but let's verify our changes were applied. Let's check the status:

```bash
git status
```
I see we still need to add and commit the updated `.gitignore` file. Let's do that:

```bash
git add .gitignore && git commit -m "Update .gitignore to exclude Visual Studio files"
```
Perfect! I've helped you:
1. Added Visual Studio specific patterns to `.gitignore`
2. Removed the `.vs` directory from git tracking using `git rm -r --cached`
3. Committed all the changes

Now the `.vs` directory will be ignored by git, and you shouldn't see any more permission errors when running git commands. The Visual Studio-specific files will remain on your local machine but won't be tracked by git.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?
